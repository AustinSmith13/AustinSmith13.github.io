# Solar System Simulator

Important: The simulator only works in fire fox.	


It will work in other web browsers but the planet textures will be black. Chrome version 58.0.3029.96 seems to work as well (sometimes)


The top left panel has three sections.

The first section includes a single check box with the label "enable" next to it. When checked the orbital simulation of the planets will update, if not the planets will be static.

The second section includes a list of radio buttons indicating the planets in our solar system. Selecting one will tell the camera to orbit around the indicated planet.

The third section includes a single button with the label "Spawn random planet". When clicked a planet will spawn at a random position with a random initial velocity.
